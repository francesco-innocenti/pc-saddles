This repo holds code for the NeurIPS 2024 paper [Only Strict Saddles in the Energy Landscape of Predictive Coding Networks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11979). 
You can read [my blog post](https://francesco-innocenti.github.io/posts/2024/10/01/The-Energy-Landscape-of-Predictive-Coding-Networks/) for the key ideas of the paper. 

# Reproducibility

All the results and plots from the paper can be reproduced from the included notebooks. All notebooks except for the convergence experiments can be run in reasonable time (< 15min) on a CPU. For the heavier convergence experiments, we recommend using a GPU.
